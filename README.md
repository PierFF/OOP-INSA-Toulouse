# OOP-INSA-Toulouse
This repositories contains the files that you need to execute tutorial code and work on the exercises for the **really awsome :-)** Object Oriented Tutorial 2025.
You need a basic `jupyter`, `jupyter-lab` or Visual Studio Code installation with `numpy` and `scipy` in order to execute them.
Be patient and may the galss breaking hammer guide your recursive insight !!!
